The idea behind musicmeshfs is to let him organize music (mp3, ogg, flac... files) using on tags (author, title, year, album...).

The interface let the user say the way to use tags, using a simple "keyword-based" schema (something like "%artist/%year - %album/%track - %title.%type").


Please, use the svn!
